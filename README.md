# quantum-mastermind

Submission for the Qiskit Community Summer Jam.

Quantum Mastermind is an extension of the classic game, Mastermind. In our version, you use quantum gates to build circuits that then generate the patterns you guess. It is intended to be an education experience to teach the basics of quantum computing, quantum circuits, and quantum gates.

We built this game using Python, Qiskit, and the Arcade library. You can install these dependencies with: 

```python
pip install qiskit
pip install arcade
```
